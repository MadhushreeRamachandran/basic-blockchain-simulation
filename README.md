# basic-blockchain-simulation
This is a simple blockchain project that I created to understand the core concepts of blockchain technology. It allows you to add data (like transactions or messages) into a block, mine the block, and link it to a growing chain of blocks. I used hashing and basic cryptography to ensure the integrity of the chain!!
