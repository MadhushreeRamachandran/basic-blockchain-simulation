# Blockchain Simulation Project

This is a simple blockchain simulation created to understand the core concepts of blockchain technology. It allows users to add data to the blockchain, mine blocks, and explore the chain using basic cryptography to ensure integrity and security. This project demonstrates the fundamental workings of decentralized systems.

## Features

- Add new blocks to the chain with custom data (e.g., messages or transactions).
- View the entire blockchain and its history of blocks.
- Demonstrates the use of cryptographic hashing and Proof of Work to validate blocks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x installed.
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) to view and edit the code.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` (optional but useful) for sending HTTP requests.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
 
2. Install any necessary dependencies (if using any libraries in your code):

3. Run the Flask application : python app.py
